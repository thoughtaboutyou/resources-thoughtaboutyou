May I Use Openclipart for?
We put together a small chart of as many possibilities and questions we have heard from people asking how they may use Openclipart. If you have an additional question, feel the love@openclipart.org.

Unlimited Commercial Use
Lots of image projects use confusing words such as images being royalty free, then you read the fine-print and find there are fees or limitations on how you might use an image. We try to make it clear that you may use all clipart even for unlimited commercial use. We believe that giving away our images is a great way to share with the world our talents and that will come back around in a better form.

May Clipart Be Used?
Openclipart may be used for any purpose, including unlimited commercial productions, as royalty-free clipart, for schools, churches, commercial and non-commercial reasons. The Openclipart community believes that clipart should be removed of as many restrictions as humanly possible so that the clipart may spread as far and wide as un-imaginable. If in doubt, use our clipart. The following chart explains clearly common uses we allow, which is all uses.
